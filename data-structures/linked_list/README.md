# Linked List and Node Data Types
Create an linked list class with methods Insert, Search, and concatenate String

## Challenge
Create these methods recursively!

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Original approach is to use recursive methods to use solve for string concatenation and for value parsing.  

Big O of:
  Insert
    O(1)
  Search
    O(N)
  __str__
    O(N)
Time Complexity
