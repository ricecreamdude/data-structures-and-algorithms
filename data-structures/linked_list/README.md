## Challenge
Create these methods recursively!

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Original approach is to use recursive methods to use solve for string concatenation and for value parsing.
