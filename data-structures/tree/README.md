# Trees
Algorithms for creating and testing binary trees / binary search trees.  This includes code for binary tree nodes, plain binary trees, and binary search trees.

## Challenge
Create the following:

Binary Tree Node:
  self.value
  self.left
  self.value  

Binary Tree:
  self.head

  def preOrder():
  def inOrder():
  def postOrder():

Binary Search Tree:
  def add():
  def 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Typical approach to solve these problems are to use recursion within the methods in order to traverse the list, and in order to achieve O( log(n) )


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->

  def preOrder():
  def inOrder():
  def postOrder():


  def add():
  def contains():
