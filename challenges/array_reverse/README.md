## Challenge
Goal of this challenge is to create a python script that takes a string of numbers separated by spaces, convert this into a list, then to reverse this list. 
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Original approach was to use a for loop and pop values off of the original array into a new array.  Big O complexity of this approach is O(n^2)
