# Challenge Summary
Coding Challenge Question - Search for data in an array  
## Challenge Description
Create a recursive function that interates through a given array using log(N) time complexity.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I decided to use recursion for this function.  My approach was to first define my base cases, then to create logic pushing the algorith left or right.

O( log(n) )

Space Complexity = 1
