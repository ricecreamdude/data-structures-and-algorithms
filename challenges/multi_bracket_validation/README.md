# Challenge Summary
Validate a string of brackets 
## Challenge Description
Our goal is to validate a string of three types of brackets in a similar way that a code editor would.

When a computer program renders code, stack technology is used to execute methods. This alogorithm uses a similar approach. We are testing for these bracket types: [] () {}

Inputs is be a string of brackets.  Our algorithm splits the string into a list where each element is a single bracket character.  Bracket objects are then added to our stack and can only be removed if the bracket object at the top of the stack is followed by the closing bracket of that type.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I approached this method using if/else logic.  

O(N)
Space Complexity = 1
