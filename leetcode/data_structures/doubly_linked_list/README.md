#Doubly Linked List

These data structure recreations are being made in order to solve the LRU Cache problem. 
The optimal solution seems to be using a doubly linked list, and a hash table, to solve the problem.


##Properties

##Methods

  1. Add a node at the front
  2. Insert node after a provided datapoint
  3. Add a node at the end
  4. Add a node before a given node


##Qualities
  1. If the capacity of the algorithm is reached, the tail or the head will be removed as new components are added in.
